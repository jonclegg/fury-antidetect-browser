"""The branding, which has to be visible to the operator and invisible to a site.

0900 renames the product: the bundle is Fury.app, the helpers are Fury Helper,
the About page says Fury. That is the half everyone thinks of.

The half that matters is the other one — none of it may reach a page. A profile
whose `navigator.userAgent` says Fury, or whose Sec-CH-UA brand list carries it,
has told every site it visits which browser it is, and there are perhaps a few
hundred of them in the world. The rename must stop at the process boundary.

So this checks both directions:

  * the built bundle really is renamed, on disk and in Info.plist, and the
    helpers with it — a mixed set (Fury.app spawning Chromium Helper) is a
    packaging bug an operator would meet at first launch.
  * `navigator.userAgent`, `navigator.appName`, `appCodeName`, `vendor`,
    `userAgentData.brands` and `chrome.runtime` carry NO trace of it, in the
    page AND in a worker.

Usage: core/verify/verify-0900.py <core binary>
