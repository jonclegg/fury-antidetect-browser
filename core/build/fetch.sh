# -g is a BSD flag. macOS has it, GNU coreutils does not, and Git Bash on
# Windows ships GNU — so this line printed "df: unknown option -- g" and, under
# `set -e`, took the whole script down before a single byte was fetched. Found
# by the first person to run fetch.sh on Windows, thirty seconds in.
#
# -Pk is POSIX: 1024-byte blocks, portable everywhere, same answer on both.
#
# 150 is for a first fetch. Moving an existing tree between milestones needs a
# fraction of it -- 153 -> 155 on the Windows box fetched a few GB -- so
# FURY_MIN_FREE_GB lowers the bar for that case (used 29.09.2026 on a laptop
# with 109 GB free and a 70 GB tree already in place).

# --- one-time depot_tools bootstrap -----------------------------------------
# gn and friends need python3_bin_reldir.txt, which only appears after a
# bootstrap. DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE=0 (kept, for reproducible builds) suppresses the
# implicit one, so run it explicitly — and run it with cwd INSIDE depot_tools,
# because its scripts resolve relative paths from the working directory, not
# from their own location. Invoking it as ./depot_tools/ensure_bootstrap fails
# with a confusing "cipd_client_version.digests: No such file" instead.
#
# On Windows this is a different program, and running the POSIX one there is not
# a degraded bootstrap but no bootstrap at all. Measured 15.08.2026 on the first
# Windows run: `./ensure_bootstrap` printed "Python was not found; run without
# arguments to install from the Microsoft Store" — the App Execution Alias stub
# answering, because the POSIX path expects a system python that Windows does
# not have — and then returned 0, so `set -e` let the script continue as though
# it had worked.
#
# It had not. The Windows bootstrap lives in bootstrap/win_tools.bat and is
# triggered by running gclient.bat once; among other things it CREATES git.bat,
# which is not in the depot_tools repository. gclient sync then died with a bare
# FileNotFoundError out of git_cache.py:218, where `git_exe` is 'git.bat' on
# Windows and the surrounding except clause catches only CalledProcessError.

# Nothing in that traceback names the bootstrap.
