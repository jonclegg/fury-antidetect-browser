# ninja writes the five helper applications as standalone bundles beside

# (GPU)" and two things called "Fury" in Spotlight, none of which anybody can

# `.metadata_never_index`, which is the documented answer and the obvious first
# try, does NOT work on macOS 26. Both bundles were indexed. It is written below

universalizer.py walks both trees and merges every Mach-O file it finds, which
is why Chromium ships it.
